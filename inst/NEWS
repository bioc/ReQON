CHANGES in ReQON VERSION 1.2.0
-------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

	- Output BAM file keeps input header and adds header line:
		"@CO Quality scores were recalibrated with ReQON." 
	- Allow threshold options (nerr and nrf) to remove positions from
		the training set that are likely to contain incorrect error calls.
		(e.g., novel variants and systematic mapping errors)
	- diagnostic output now outputs flagged read positions ($FlagPos) and 
		regression coefficients ($coeff)
		
CHANGES in ReQON VERSION 1.3.2
-------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

	- ReQON no longer recalibrates 'N' bases.  It returns the original quality
		score for these bases in the output BAM file.
	- Minor modifications have been made to FWSEplot.R.  Points are now shaded
		according to the relative frequency of bases assigned that quality score.
		See the reference manual for more details.
